# Dymaxion Puzzle Game

This puzzle game was my submission for the Open Call for Google Developer Day 2011 HTML 5 Competition https://sites.google.com/site/opencallxhtml5/ I was chosen as a finalist to attend Google Developer Day Tokyo 2011.

I used Gyudon.js https://github.com/aiham/Gyudon.js (a 2D Canvas Javascript Library that I previously created) to make this game as quickly as possible.

The photos used in this game were all taken by me while travelling around Japan.
